        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Making the Batter</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the onions thinly and place in a mixing bowl or vessel.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup of besan (gram flour) to the sliced onions.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt or as required.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of oil to this mixture. You can even add less salt, but these pakoras taste better when they are a bit salty.</li>
            <li>With your finger tips mix the besan, salt and oil very well with the onions well. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 to 6 mins, as the onions would leave moisture. If the mixture looks too moist then add 1 to 2 teaspoons more of the gram flour.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Frying</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil for deep frying in a deep pan/vessel or kadai.</li>
            <li>For crispy bhajis ensure the oil is hot. You could do a small test by adding a pinch of batter to the oil if it rises smoothly and gradually, then add spoonfuls of the batter to the hot oil. Fry the onion bhajis on a medium flame, else they won't fry evenly.</li>
            <li>While frying, flip the bhajis with a slotted spoon. Fry few bhajis at a time.</li>
            <li>Fry them till they turn crisp and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the onion bhaji with a slotted spoon and place on absorbent kitchen napkins or kitchen paper towels.</li>
            <li>In the same way fry the rest of onion bhaji.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with fried green chilies, spicy green chutney or tomato ketchup.</li>
        </ol>
